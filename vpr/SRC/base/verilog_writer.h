/*
verilog_writer.c defines the main functions used to:

1) identify the primitives in a design
2) find the connectivity between primitives
3) Write the verilog code representing the post-synthesized (packed,placed,routed) design consisting of LUTs, IOs, Flip Flops, Multiplier blocks, and RAM blocks
4) Write the Standard Delay Format(SDF) file corresponding to the verilog code mentioned in (3). The SDF file contains all the timing information of the design which
allows the user to perform timing simulation
